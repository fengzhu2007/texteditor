    \title Snippets for Editors

    Snippets typically consist of chunks of code in a programming language (although they
    can also be plain text) which you would like to avoid re-typing every time. They
    are triggered in the same way as the completions (see \l{CodeAssist}{Providing
    Code Assist}).

    In order to create a new group of snippets two steps are necessary:
    \list
        \li Register the group with TextEditor::SnippetProvider::registerGroup
        \li Create an XML configuration file and place it in the
        /share/qtcreator/snippets directory. As an example of the file format
        please take a look at the already available ones. The meaning and consistency rules
        of the fields are described below:
        \list
            \li group - This is the group in which the snippet belongs in the user interface.
            It must match TextEditor::SnippetProvider::groupId().
            \li id - A unique string that identifies this snippet among all others available.
            The recommended practice is to prefix it with the group so it is easier to have
            such control on a file level.
            \li trigger - The sequence of characters to be compared by the completion engine
            in order to display this snippet as a code assist proposal.
            \li complement - Additional information that is displayed in the code assist
            proposal so it is possible to disambiguate similar snippets that have the
            same trigger.
        \endlist
    \endlist

    All XML configuration files found in the directory mentioned above are parsed by
    Qt Creator. However, only the ones which are associated with known groups (specified
    by a provider) are taken into consideration.
